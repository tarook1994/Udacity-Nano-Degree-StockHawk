# Stock Hawk

This is  project 3 in Udacity's [Android Developer Nanodegree].
Stock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

# What I Learned
- Diagnose existing issues with an app.
- Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
- Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget to your app experience.
- Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.
